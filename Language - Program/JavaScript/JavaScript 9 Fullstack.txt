If you are tuning in to this in 2023 like me, keep in mind there are some sweeping changes in the latest version of React and React Router DOM - so following this tutorial may get confusing. 

Keep the index.js that create-react-app gives you as its updated for React version 18. 

For React Router DOM, "Switch" has been changed to "Routes" and "component" has been switched to "element" and requires you to invoke the React element not just pass it, like so:

<Route path='/' element={<Home />} />

Cheers to everyone taking the step to better yourself!
