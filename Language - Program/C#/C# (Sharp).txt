TypeScipt	->	JavaScript but offers strict static typing as an option but will allow dynamic typing, as well. 
			As a result, TypeScript code is safer but a little trickier to write, resulting in more errors earlier in development.

Its more useful to think about it as scripting language vs non scripting language
Rather than interpreter verus complier
But nornally you use the default complier with the language
C++ tends to be the only one where complier choice matters
The main difference is for say c++/c#
To run the code
The code complies creates a binary and runs the binaries
Some IDEs like vs mask this behaviour
While for scripts you just run the script
The code is your binary
